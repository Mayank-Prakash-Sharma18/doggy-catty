## Pros of owning a Cat

### Cats are wonderful Companions 

Cats make a wonderful companion and friend. They can take away your loneliness, anxiety and stress in a jiffy, and make you feel good inside. Just like dogs, cats have been proved to have a good emotional and psychological effect on their owners. It's somewhat similar to having a child. 

They will cheer up even the most serious souls. You want proof? Just have a look at the number of cat videos on the internet. The goofy stuff a cat does, the energy they put into doing dumb things is hilarious and entertaining. When you get a cat for your household, it essentially means you are getting a few daily laughs. 

There is a common belief that dogs are more attached to their owners, while cats are more attached to the house. However, it might not be entirely true. Cats do make strong bonds with their caregivers and they can give you a lot of love and affection. But they take a little more time to bond than a dog, and their affection towards you is going to be qualitatively different than a dog's. Cats will not show their love towards you as directly as a dog would. But you will get to know that they like you via some of their demeanour. 

So, it's not surprising that some studies have found that owning cats is good for the health of your heart and help you sleep better, especially the women. 

### Cats are suitable for small houses

If you live in a small house or an apartment, then cats are a better choice than dogs. 

It's especially true if your neighbours live very close. Dogs will bark, especially the small ones. Your neighbours may not appreciate the excessive noise. This is not going to be a problem if you get a cat. 

Moreover, dogs need a lot of space to run around. You will also need to take them out for a walk daily. This is a headache that you can avoid with cats. Cats can be trained to do their daily business in a litter box, inside the house itself. They do not need much space to run around either. 

### Cats are low maintenance

As compared to dogs, cats are low maintenance. You don't need to take them out for a walk. Just keep a litter box at home. 

Cats also smell less than dogs, so you need not give them regular baths. The only smell you will get, will be from their litter box. So, just keep it clean. 

If you are a very busy person, then a cat may be a better choice than a dog. 

### Cats keep your house pest free

Cats are natural predators, that will hunt down many pests in your house, especially the mice. So, if you have a mice problem, getting a cat may be a good idea. However, make sure that your cat does not eat the mouse after hunting it down, as it may contract some disease from it. 


## Cons of owning a Cat

### Shedding

Just like dogs, cats shed hair a lot. Though it will depend on the breed of the cat too. Long-haired cats will shed a lot more. There will be furs everywhere. 

It also varies as per the season. In warmer season, the shedding will increase. But cats do shed a little even in colder seasons. So, you will have to do regular vacuuming and cleaning. 

### Medical Expenses

Getting a cat, or any pet for that matter, means that you will have to spend some money on their medical care. Depending on where you live, it may be manageable or really expensive. If the vet services are really expensive in your area, you may get medical insurance for your pet cat. That will cover some of the risks. 

### Cleaning Litter boxes

This is probably going to be your least favourite chore. But if you have a cat, then you will need to have a litter box and you must keep it clean. Otherwise, your cat may not use it. Many cats are very finicky. Get a new litter box, if the old one is in a really bad condition. 

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Note</b><br>

Many people abandon their cats because their cats keep on doing their business elsewhere, rather than the litter box. It's a very common problem. It may vary from cat to cat. 

Sometimes, cats may not use a litter box due to some medical issue. So, do consult a doctor if your cat has suddenly stopped using a litter box even after training. 

The issue may also be behavioural or training related. Do consult an expert if the situation persists.

### Cats can damage things

Unlike dogs, cats can climb things, and because they are so active, they often break things intentionally or unintentionally. 

They also have very sharp claws. They can scratch your furniture and glass etc. To reduce the damage, you may:
* Get a scratch post and train your cat to use it.
* Trim the nails of your cat. But kindly never get your cat declawed; it's a pretty cruel thing to do.  
* Do not get things that are easily scratchable, e.g. leather.

Dogs chew things, Cats scratch things.

### Cats can make you sick

There are many diseases that you may get from your cat, such as:
* Allergy - Some people are allergic to cats. So, before you get a cat, make sure no one in your family is allergic to cat. To do so, you may expose them to cats of your friends/relatives or take them to a pet shop. If anyone gets some allergic reaction, drop the idea of getting a pet cat.

  <b>Note</b><br>

However, as per some studies exposing your kids to cats early on, may reduce their chances of developing allergies later on in their life. 
</div>
 
* Parasites - Cats may carry many parasites, especially in their claws. 

The best way to avoid most of the above issues is to wash your hands regularly (especially before eating something), vacuum your house, do not let your cat lick or scratch you etc.  

### Restrictions on Social life

Getting a cat or any pet, puts a lot of restrictions on your social life and freedom. It's like having a child. You cannot do night-outs, cannot go on long vacations etc. Even if you are going out of the house for sometime, you will have to make sure that there is someone to take care of your cats. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

They also tend to wake up their owners very early in the morning. So, you won't be able to do late-nights anyways. It's something that cats and dogs share.
</div>

And it's not only about their feeding issue, or their safety. Cats sometimes put themselves in dangerous situations as they are very curious by nature and keep jumping on things. So, there should always be someone to keep an eye on them. 

Once you know all the benefits, disadvantages and risks associated with cat ownership, you may now make up your mind whether you want to go ahead with the idea, or drop it altogether. And yes, do discuss all this with your family too before you seal the deed. It's absolutely essential!
