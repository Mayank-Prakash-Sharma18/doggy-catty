Though our family is vegetarian, my dog loves eating eggs, and often treats himself with some meat too. Though he often eats vegetables and fruits. But it still came as a surprise when I saw him eating grass one day, like a goat!

I thought that probably he’s doing it for fun or for curiosity’s sake. But it soon became evident that he was not feeling well. Probably, it was kind of a self-medication. So, I started exploring.

In this article, I am going to share with you what I have learnt regarding this grass-eating habit of dogs.

## Reasons behind dogs eating grass

This is not limited to a few dogs. Dogs, in general, tend to eat grass when they are feeling unwell. Some eat grass even when they are healthy. So, there maybe a variety of reasons for this.

### Digestive Issues

As per some experts, dogs eat grass when they are having digestive problems or gas issues. They eat grass to induce vomiting. However, it’s not necessary that a dog will vomit after eating grass. As per a study, only about 1 in 4 dogs vomit after eating grass. So, this theory is doubtful. 

As per many experts, dogs may also eat grass if they are feeling constipated. Grass has a lot of fiber and that helps them to pass their stool with ease. It also helps them to pass on any parasites that may have gotten into their intestine. 

### Dogs are Omnivores

As per some people, we should not read too much into this habit of theirs. Dogs eat a lot of strange things, maybe out of curiosity or just because they like it. I have seen even healthy dogs eating grass. It can only be explained if they really like eating grass, or maybe they just like chewing it. 
And you should not be surprised if they do so.

Unlike cats, which are purely carnivores, dogs are omnivores, i.e. they can eat both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diet. In fact, wolves, coyotes and other such animals closely related to dogs regularly eat plant-based diet in the wild. 

So, if your dog is eating a lot of non-veg, then he may eat grass to quench his plant-diet cravings. 

### Nutritional Deficiency

Though grass is majorly made up of cellulose, which a dog cannot digest, but it has minor amounts of other minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, potassium, etc. If your dog is deficient in these minerals, then he may fulfil this requirement of his body by eating a lot of grass. 

This theory is supported by the fact that some dogs only eat a certain type of grass that is rich in these minerals. Or maybe, they just like the taste of certain types of grass.

A dog may also start eating grass if he’s hungry. This behaviour is seen more in case of young puppies, who are also very curious in nature. 

So, make sure that your dog eats well. Do not only feed him non-veg diet. Give him some vegetables, and fruits to eat too. My dog likes eating carrots, peas, potato, cabbage, etc. So much so that he often used to steal them from our kitchen when he was a kid! 


## Can grass eating be hazardous?

If your dog is indulging in grass-eating now and then, then it’s not a big issue. Animals often know how to treat some of their minor ailments. You should let your dog eat it.

However, make sure that there are no poisonous plants around, or that grass has not been sprinkled with some fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, or other such harmful chemicals. 

Also, if you observe your dog eating grass in large quantities, or on a frequent basis, then you should definitely take him to a vet and get him checked. Try to add variety of nutritious food items in his diet. 

Eating grass in excessive quantities may also cause other problems, because he may ingest some bugs or dirt in the process. This increases the probability of some bug entering his body, and causing other health problems. 

As a practical solution, you may grow some good quality grass inside your home – in your garden, porch, or in a pot. At least he will eat clean, home-grown grass. 


## Winding Up

So, grass-eating in dogs is not a big deal. Just be a bit vigilant. Make sure your dog is not suffering from some nutritional deficiency, or showing symptoms of some underlying digestive problem. 

Maybe he has developed a habit of eating grass. Maybe it’s just a compulsive behaviour, like many humans like to pluck grass while sitting in a garden. It may also be a sign of your dog being under some kind of stress or suffering from anxiety. Make sure your dog is happy, and ensure that there are no underlying psychological factors behind this habit of his/hers. 

If it’s just a matter of bad habit, then it can easily be changed via mild training. However, do not forcefully stop him from eating grass. Never punish him for it. It may do more harm then good. 

And yes, thank your stars. At least he’s just going for the grass, and not poop, as many dogs do!
