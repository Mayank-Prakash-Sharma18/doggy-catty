In this article, we are going to explore what fish breeds we can keep as pets in India (though it will be applicable to many other countries too).

  <b>Warning</b><br>

Whenever, you go to buy a fish, make sure that you buy the breeds that can live together. If you already have some fishes in your aquarium, then make sure that you do research on what fishes can live with them peacefully. Also, inform the fish seller about the fishes you already have. These guys know a lot about what fishes can be kept together. He will help you out. We will write a separate article on this topic. 

Also, do inspect the fish to some extent. Make sure that it’s not infected by fungus, or is not on medication. Otherwise, it may infect other fishes in your aquarium too – as the saying goes “One Bad Fish Can Spoil the Whole Pond.”

Moreover, you should buy the fish as per the size of the fish tank you have. Buy smaller size fishes if your aquarium is small. Also, ask the shopkeeper the maximum size the fishes will attain once they grow up. If you will keep big fishes in small aquariums, then they will die soon.

## Common Pet Fish breeds in India

Here’s some of the most popular fishes you will find in India. 

### Goldfish

They are one of the most popular fishes in India. If properly taken care of, they can easily live 15 to 20 years. Some gold fishes have been known to live till 25-30 years of age. 
<img src="../../images/post/goldfish.jpg" alt="fishes" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

It’s better to keep goldfishes in bare bottom tank. That’s because they eat a lot and make the tank dirty pretty soon. Bare bottom tanks are easier to clean. Make sure you remove the dirt from the water on a daily basis – for this you may need to change 10-20% of tank water daily.

So, they can live in small aquariums without oxygen pump. However, do ensure that the water filter is good. Water should be clean, i.e. no ammonia, no nitrate, no chlorine, no faeces.

## Which fish should I buy?

There are too many options to choose from. Isn’t it?

If you are spoilt for choices and want our opinion, then here it is:

* If you have a small fish tank, say 1 feet tank, then you can keep these fishes in it - Guppy fishes, Molly fishes, Betta fishes, Gourami fishes (smaller ones), small size Barb fishes (e.g. Tiger Barb), Swordtail, etc. These fishes are the best if kept in a group of 6-8. They are easy to maintain – even a single oxygen pump and sponge filter is enough. So, these fishes are good for beginners. Just make sure you do not overfeed these small fishes. 

* If you have a slightly bigger fish tank, say 2 feet tank, then you can keep these fishes in it – small-size Goldfishes (say 3-4), big size Gourami fishes, big size Barb fishes, Rainbow fishes, Tetras, etc. Again, make sure to keep smaller fishes in a group of at least 6-12. 

* If you have a slightly bigger fish tank, say 3 feet tank, then you can keep these fishes in it – large-size Goldfishes, small-size Arowana fishes, large-size Flowerhorn fishes, Angle fishes, Oscars (not more than 2), Discus (not more than 4-5), etc. If Arowana fish grows to 1 feet, then you need at least 4-5 feet tank for them. 

As your tank-size gets getting bigger, your option keeps on increasing. Then you can keep, bigger fishes too - monster fishes, dragon fishes, etc. Hope, you get that idea. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

If you maintain your fishes well, then they will live much longer. Feed them regularly, change aquarium water frequently, keep them in large aquariums, do not put too many fishes in the same aquarium, give them medication whenever needed, maintain proper pH level of water, ensure proper temperature (heating), etc.

The prices mentioned above are retail prices. So, they will vary from place to place and with time. If you live near a fish breeding centre or buy fishes from a wholesale market, these fishes will cost you even less.

Most of the people think that fishes die in 2-3 years. However, that’s not true for every fish.

Here’s a list of some fishes that are pretty hardy, and are known to live for many years.

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Fishes that are very sensitive and can die suddenly</b><br>

These fishes are very sensitive and die pretty soon if not properly cared for:

* Cat fish or Sucker fish - They will die if their living conditions are changed suddenly, e.g. if temperature of water changes suddenly, pH level changes, or water quality degrades, etc. 

* Discus – Though they can live for 10-15 years or even more. But for that to happen make sure that they are properly taken care of. Otherwise, they tend to die soon. 

* Tiger Barbs – These are warm water fishes, and will not tolerate cold water at all. So, check for water quality, ammonia level in water, temperature, any signs of infection, etc. 

* Angel fishes – Especially black angle fishes, and white angle fishes. These are also warm water fishes, and will not tolerate cold water. Their mouth is also very small and they often cannot eat large food pellets that you put in the tank. So, once you throw the food in their tank, do monitor whether they are able to eat it or not. 

* Kissing Gouramis 

* Glow fish 

* Dyed Parrot fish

In fact, their sensitivity may vary, but even the strongest fish will die soon if not constantly taken care of.

## Aggressive Aquarium Fishes

Here’s a list of some aggressive aquarium fishes, if you are one of those souls who like predator type breeds. 

Do not keep these fishes with other gentle type fishes or else they may bully or harm them, or even kill and eat them. Most of these fishes attack the fishes that are smaller in size than them (i.e. those that look like potential prey). 

* Arowana - Called water monkeys, as they can jump above water to catch their prey, e.g. insects. These are South-American carnivorous fishes, that can eat other fishes that are smaller than their mouth. 

<div class="toc-mak">
