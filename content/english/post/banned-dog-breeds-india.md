If you want to know which dog breeds are banned in India legally,  the answer is simple - none!  Indians do not have any restrictions in keeping any dog breed, nor any registration is required.   

Though India has imposed ban on import of foreign breed of dogs,  there is no fine or penalty if you already owe a foreign breed of dog.

But in many other countries there are a lot of restrictions. Certain breeds of dogs (e.g. Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, American Bulldog, German Shephard, Argentine Dogos, Doberman Pinscher, Japanese Tosa Inus, etc) are banned in different countries. These cannot be kept as pets, as they are considered to be dangerous. Similarly, in some places certain breeds can be kept only at farmhouses for protection, and not at homes. In some places even small dogs like Pugs are banned. This is not the case in India. Indian Governments mostly leave it on the discretion of the pet owners.

## Dog breeds that should be banned in India

Though it's legal to own any kind of dog in India,  there should preferably be some restrictions on some breed of dogs.  The reasons behind it may differ from climate to safety concerns. 

Also, you should avoid getting these dogs as pets in India. 

Let us see some of these dog breeds.

### Cold Climate Dogs

Some dogs like Alaskan Malmute, St. Bernard and Siberian Husky are suitable only for cold climates, as they have heavy fur. If they are kept in some hot and humid areas of India, these breeds will suffer. Though they can be kept in cold parts of the country, but it will be hard to stop them from being transferred to other hot areas by people. 

### Dangerous Dogs

Dogs like Rottweiler are very dangerous, especially if they have not been properly trained. In India, people are not very keen on professionally training their dogs. Rather dogs are just a status symbol and some people think that having a ferocious dog is cool. 

Often people find managing these dogs difficult in a short span of time and so these dogs end up in dog shelters or on streets. 


## Are pitbull dogs banned in India?

The answer is No! There is no ban on owning a Pitbull dog in India. Whether you should own one is a matter of choice. But you must know that this is a deadly dog and there have been numerous cases where pitbulls have attacked and even killed people, including their owners. Drop the idea of owning a pitbull if you have a family. 

Also, pitbulls are not registered breeds on the papers of Kennel Club of India (KCI). 


## Can some dog breeds be banned in India in future?

Chandigarh Municipal Corporation in 2019 was deliberating to ban dangerous breed of pet dogs such as Rottweiler and Pitbull. Such an idea was also tossed up in National Dog Conference. So, the idea of banning some ferocious guard dogs is brewing in various organizations. 

This has been because if some cases of attacks and even killings by these guard dogs like pitbulls and Rottweilers. So, don't be surprised if a ban is imposed on such breeds by some municipal level local organizations, if not on a national level.  


## Winding Up

So, no breeds are banned in India as of now. But in times to come some breeds can be expected to be banned. 

However, even if a ban is imposed, it will not effect those people who have already adopted or buyed such a dog/puppy. Dog-owners who already possess these dogs will be allowed to keep them till their life span. But no new registration of such dogs will be done.

Ban or no ban, we should avoid buying cold climate breeds (if we are living in hot areas) and some deadly breeds.
