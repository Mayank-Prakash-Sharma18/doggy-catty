In this article we are going to list down some of the animal species and certain breeds that cannot be kept as pets in India. 

To give you a general idea, the species which are dangerous, or those that are getting extinct, are often illegal to own. Same goes for wild breeds of some animals. 

So, before you adopt or buy some out-of-the-ordinary animal species, or get home some exotic animal breed, have a look at the lists provided in this article.

  <b>Warning</b><br>

As per Wildlife Protection Act (1972) of India, you may be jailed for up to 3 years and/or fined if you are in possession of or dealing with such an animal/bird/reptile (in general the wild native species). 

However, many of these animals can be kept in government zoos.

Let's start with the birds. Then we will move on to our four-legged friends and then some other species too.

## List of illegal pet birds in India

We will start with parrots and pigeons, the two most popular pet birds in India (in fact South Asia in general). Though we can keep them as pets, but some of their breeds are banned, especially the wild ones. 

So, we cannot keep any parrot that is found in the wild in India, as your pet. This rules out - ***Plum Headed Parakeets, Indian Ring-necked Parakeet, Alexandrine Parakeet, Red-breasted Parakeet*** etc. Though you can keep the foreign breeds as pets, e.g. budgies and cockatiels. 

Why is it so?  

Because all Indian wild animals (including birds) are protected under Indian Wildlife Protection Act. The birds of foreign origin may not fall in this protected category. 

Similarly, the animals and birds that are pet by nature (i.e. the domesticated breeds) are not protected by Indian Wildlife Protection Act. As the name suggests, it protects only the "wildlife". 

So, you can keep white pigeons as pets in India. It's absolutely fine. However, keeping the ***wild grey pigeon, Emerald Dove etc.*** will be deemed illegal.

  <b>Pigeons and Doves</b><br>

Pigeons and Doves belong to the same family of birds (Columbidae). They have many similar features, but doves are in general smaller in size as compared to pigeons.

Some other birds that you ***cannot*** keep as pet in India are:
* Indian Peacock
* Indian Roller
* Barn Owl, Indian Eagle Owl
* Black Kite, Indian Kite
* Black Hill Myna (Indian Myna)
* Indian Lal Munia or Red Avadavat, Scaly Breasted Munia, Chestnut Munia
* Raptor
* Indian Vulture

  <b>Note</b><br>

However, some very exotic species of birds ***can be kept as pet*** in India. However, some of them may be high maintenance, not easily available, and really expensive. They have been listed below:

* Mandarin Ducks - blue-white complexion (Estimated price in India is over Rs. 10,000)

* Golden Pheasant - golden-yellow colour (Estimated price in India is over Rs. 15,000)

* Sun Conure Parrots - they have the colour of the rising sun (Estimated price in India is over Rs. 15,000)

* Rainbow Lorikeet Parrots - Australian in origin (Estimated price in India is over Rs. 30,000)

* Blue and Gold Macaw, Military Macaw, Scarlet Macaw, Hyacinth Macaw (costs lakhs of rupees)

* Palm Cockatoo (Estimated price in India is over Rs. 10 lakhs)

* Toco Toucan (Estimated price in India is over Rs. 7 lakhs)

## List of illegal pet animals in India

Apart from dogs and cats, rabbits are one of the most famous pets that people keep at their homes (though ideally, they need large spaces). So, let's talk about rabbits first of all. 

Yes, you can keep rabbits as pets in India, but only the domestic white rabbits or some exotic foreign breeds (e.g. Angora Rabbit). Keeping the Indian wild hare (which is a little brownish in colour) as a pet is illegal in India. 

Similarly, you can keep domestic pig, but not the wild boar. Same logic applies to cats.

  <b>Warning</b><br>

As per "The Indian Wildlife Protection Act", 1972, it is illegal to keep as pets any animal or bird that is ***found in the wild in India***."
</div> 

Here's an exhaustive list of the animals that are certainly ***banned*** as pets in India:
* Rhesus Macaque (Indian wild monkey)
* Lion-tailed Macaque (Langoor)
* Asian Elephant, Indian Rhinoceros, Sloth Bear, Indian Gray Mongoose, Indian Gaur, Indian Muntiac Deer 
* Asiatic Lion, Bengal Tiger, Indian Leopard, Asiatic Cheetah (obviously!)

While vast number of people own dogs, but some dog breeds are considered pretty dangerous, e.g. Pitbull. There have been some instances wherein they have attacked and killed people, including their owners. However, they are not illegal to own in India, but there have been demands to ban them.

  <b>Note</b><br>

However, there are some exotic animal species that ***can be kept as pet*** in India. You may explore these options if you are one of those daring types or someone who likes to have new experiences in life when it comes to man-animal bonding.
* Guinean Pig
* African Pygmy Hedgehog
* Sugar Glider
* Pygmy Marmoset
* Red Handed Tamarin

## List of illegal pet reptiles in India

Here's a list of some reptiles that may land you in trouble with authorities in India:
* Indian Star Tortoise, Indian Roofed Turtle, Indian Tent Turtle, Flapshell Turtle, Black Pond Turtle 
* Indian Cobra, Indian Rock Python, Red Sand Boa
* Indian Gharial 
* Monitor Lizard

However, if you are into exotic reptiles, you may keep Tarantula spider as a pet. However, good luck with your parents or spouse allowing that!  

Not all bans are imposed by governments. Some come from our family, friends and living situation. Keep that in mind too.
