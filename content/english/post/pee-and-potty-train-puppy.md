## How to pee and potty train puppy during the day?

Tigger also pooped inside the house once or twice. But he peed a lot inside the house. He didn't do it on purpose. How will a cute little puppy know where to pee, right?

So this will happen. It's mentioned on internet that no dog pees on his bed, but my dog did! 

### Timing is important

To reduce this thing you will have take your pup out to pee yourself. For example, after he wakes up, take him out to pee and poo, because after he wakes up chances are that the pup has to pee. Also do so after exercise or play, after eating food, before sleeping in the night and first thing in the morning after he wakes up. 

### Look for Hints

Sometimes your puppy will himself give you hints. He may do so explicitly by pulling your clothes or barking at you and asking you to follow him. Or he may also do so implicitly, e.g. by sitting at the gate on his own. Though many times you will get false positives, e.g. if you let him out he may just run around and come back. 

Also, keep in mind that he is not going to pee right away and this is acceptable. But he will surely do it, more often than not. So give him some time. 

If you take care of these points then accidents will reduce in the house. In due course of time, the pup will learn that peeing or potty in the house is not allowed, but doing it outside is allowed. 

### Reinforcements 

You may use positive and negative reinforcements to make him learn quickly. You can praise him and treat him after he pees outside and scold him a little if he does it inside. Just don't beat up the poor guy. A puppy is like a small baby after all. 

If there is a pee/potty accident inside the house, then you should scold the puppy, e.g. shout 'No' at the pup. Say 'No' in a hard tone like 'Tigger NO, NO', so that he will gets to think "Oh no what have i done?"

Don't talk to him in long sentences. He won't get it. Dah!

Only use 'No' word in a harsh tone. It would make him feel bad after hearing it. Moreover, once this word is imprinted in his mind, you may use it to stop him from doing other bad and naughty activities too. 

Also, pick him up and take him outside instantly and make him try again when outside. Although he has already peed inside the house, but you should make him try again to pee and poop outside, so that he realizes pee and potty is allowed outside 
but not inside the house. 

And remember! Do not forget to praise and love him when he gets it right. Always give him a treat. He will feel very good about it he may start going out for the love of the treat. The day I started giving my puppy treats when outside, he stopped peeing and pooping inside the house.

### No distractions  

If you are taking your pup out to pee or potty then make him pee or poop, don't play with him and don't talk to him. So that he learns it is potty break or pee break, it's not a play break. 

Else if you start playing with him after pee/potty then he will get confused that is it a pee/potty break or play break. Did i come out to pee/potty or to play?

Don't involve him in any activity, because it can divert his attention from pee/poop towards playing and he might not pee there and then and instead he might pee when you bring him in. It's frustrating and you might get irritated. 

If he is not peeing when outside, not pooping either, then bring him inside within 2-3 minutes. Thereafter, within 5 minutes of bringing him in, go out again for him to try peeing again. This is the most important point. 

You should spend more time with the puppy inside the house than outside. If you spend more time in the house then he will know that this is my house and let me tell you a fact that puppies generally never spoil their home. 



## How to pee and potty train puppy during the night?

Now we will discuss second part of the article. Training during the night is little different. 

General rule is that, the number of hours after which a puppy needs to pee again is equal to puppy's age in month + 1 (this rule applies until the pup is 7 months of age). 

For example, if your puppy is 3 months old, then he can hold his pee for 3 + 1 = 4 hours. You can set an alarm for 4 hours
and take him outside to pee before he does it in the house. 

Initially i didn't know this. So, the first night was somewhat hard. Tigger had peed at 3-4 places in the house. We didn't know when he can pee. 

It may be that your pup doesn't pee in the night like Tigger doesn't pee in the night. By now he has learned to hold it till the morning. But your puppy might be different.


Second point for night potty training is that the last meal of the pup should be like 2-3 hours before sleeping. Say if you sleep at 10 PM then feed him at 7 PM. This will give you a gap of 2-3 hours and it will allow the pup to pee and poop before bed.

## Winding Up

Tigger took around 1 month to learn but i hope your pup learns faster. Even if your pup has completed the training, still you should continue it for some time, because pups are very young and they tend to forget easily. 

Continue the training until you are completely sure that these accidents won't happen again in the house.
