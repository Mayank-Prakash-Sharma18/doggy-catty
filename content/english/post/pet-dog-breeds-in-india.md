## Popular Pet Dog breeds in India

Here’s some of the most beloved and famous dogs you will find in India.

### Golden Retriever

These dogs are probably the cutest large-sized dogs. That’s why you will see them being featured in many dog related movies. If you do not fall in love with them as soon as you see them (especially their puppies), then probably you have a heart of a psychopath, or are dead inside! They are so sweet, that they may even give you diabetes. So, beware! 
<img src="../../images/post/golden-retriever.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

This breed was bred by hunters to do retrieving work for them. So, they are pretty active and need a lot of exercise and play time in open spaces. This makes them unsuitable for apartment life. 

It would be better if you can train them and thus channelize their energy in the right direction. But don’t worry, it’s pretty easy to train them. They will listen to you, as they are very loyal to their caregivers.  

Also, they need to be groomed properly. They have a thick fur coat, and so they shed a lot of hair. Make sure that you give them a bath on a regular basis, and brush them almost daily. Otherwise, you will find their hair almost in every nook and corner of your house. Thus, you can say that these are a bit high maintenance dogs. But they are worth it, in every way imaginable! 

### German Shepherd

These black-brown large-size dogs are pretty famous all around the world, including India. These are very loyal and loving dogs. 
<img src="../../images/post/german-shepherd.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

These dogs look cute as well as threatening – a rare combination. So, they can be kept as guard dogs too. In fact, you will see police and army all around the world taking their services. 

They are full or energy, and so need daily exercise, and training. So, they may not be kept in small apartments. 

### Labradors

These large-size dogs are popular all across the world. And why not?
<img src="../../images/post/labradors.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

These dogs look good, are very smart, loyal, easily trainable and excellent to be kept in families. Just like Golden Retrievers, they are very easy to train. You can have them as pet even if you are a first-time dog owner. 

These dogs are suitable for climatic conditions in India. That makes them even more popular. 

However, these dogs are full of energy, and so need a lot of space and time to play, run, and goof around. So, they are not suitable for apartment lifestyle. 

### Pomeranian

They are little cute white clouds of happiness. They are small-size dogs, often white in colour. 
<img src="../../images/post/pomeranian.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

Though they are not good for protection or guarding purposes, as they are so small in size. But they are often kept as alarm dogs or watch dogs. They are very alert when it comes to sound – they can hear even the faintest of noise, and then they start barking a lot. So, they are pretty handy in alerting everyone and forcing any intruder to run away. 

They are also good in hunting small animals such as rats, and squirrels. They can easily substitute cats for this purpose. Though they don’t eat rats, but will definitely kill them if they see any in your house. 

However, they may not be ideal for small apartments. Though they are small in size, and many people do keep them in small apartments, but these dogs bark a lot and their bark is pretty loud too. So, it may cause problems with your neighbours. Also, they are very active and naughty creatures, and need a lot of space to run around.

  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Though these dogs are small in size, but they think they are big. They have been seen to attack dogs thrice their size. Obviously, it never turns out well for them – they often get beaten up. So, you will have to take extra care of them. They are kind of stupid in this regard – cute but stupid!

  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Indian Spitz Vs. Pomeranian</b><br>

Indian Spitz look very similar to Pomeranian. However, they are different breeds. 
<img src="../../images/post/indian-spitz.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

Indian Spitz dogs are a bit taller than Pomeranians. Their fur is also a bit less than Pomeranians. 

Personally, I find them to be even cuter than Pomeranians, but this opinion may vary from one person to another.

### Shih Tzu

They have gained a lot of popularity in India in the last decade or two. These guys are one of the tiniest dogs out there, and super cute. 
<img src="../../images/post/shih-tzu.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

But their fur is pretty thick – so much so that sometimes it becomes difficult to tell their face from their rear! So, they will shed, and you will have to comb them regularly, or else their hair will get matted. 

They are suitable for apartment life and if you have small kids. Their demeanour is laid-back and lazy. But they do become active now and then. 

### Pug

We all have awareness regarding this dog breed – thanks to the erstwhile HUTCH company ad, where a pug was shown following its owner everywhere. 
<img src="../../images/post/pug.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

It’s a breed from China, that is quite similar to Shih Tzu – tiny, cute, and affectionate creatures. But unlike Shih Tzu, their fur coat is not very thick. So, they will not shed as much. So, they are easy to groom and maintain. 

However, health may be an issue with these dogs. So, keep a vet handy if you are planning to get this breed. 

They are perfect for apartment living, and are good with kids. Girls tend to like this dog breed a lot – though I don’t have any idea regarding the reasons behind this preference. 

### Pariah (Indian native dog or INDog)

These are dogs of pure Indian origin. They are basically the dogs you often encounter on Indian streets. 
<img src="../../images/post/pariah.jpg" alt="dogs" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

They are one of the healthiest dogs in the world, and are suitable for weather conditions in India. Their fur is not very thick, so they can comfortably live in hot and humid conditions found in various parts of the country, and will not shed much hair. 

You can easily adopt them from any animal NGO in India – no need to buy them. 

Some other dog breeds that are pretty popular in India are:
* Beagle – These are white-brown dogs of small-medium size. They were bred to be used as hound dogs to hunt down small preys like rabbits. So, if you get Beagles, then make sure that they get ample amount of exercise and play time. They are very active and naughty, and you may have to train them a bit (all hunting dogs need some training, or else they can become unruly).
* Boxer – They are highly alert and active dogs. As their energy level is quite high, they will need space to run around, play and exercise. 
* Great Dane – They are pretty large sized dogs – perhaps one of the largest dog breeds. However, as they are low energy dogs, you may keep them in apartments too, but they prefer large spaces.  But, they are not good guard dogs, as they are very friendly with almost everyone, even strangers. 
* Doberman – Just like German Shepherd, they are German dogs and are used extensively by police and military all around the world. 
* Kombai
* Dalmatian
* Dachshund 

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Rottweiler and Pitbull</b><br>

Many people also get Rottweiler and Pitbull as pet guard dogs. However, it’s a risky preposition – these dog breeds are pretty violent, and there have been instances in the past wherein they have attacked and even killed their owners. If you do get them, you will have to train them from a very young age. If you are a first-time dog owner, don’t even think about them. 

Many state governments are also mulling on the preposition of banning these dog breeds altogether (These dog breeds are banned in some countries). So, make an informed choice.

## Cheapest Dog breeds in India

Though we always encourage people to adopt pets, rather than buy them. However, sometimes the breed of our choice is not available for adoption, and the heart wants what a heart wants. 

Price of a dog breed depends on the following factors:
* Type of breed – some breeds are more expansive than others.
* Availability – Easily available dog breeds will be cheaper. 
* Breeding Quality - It also depends on the breeder. If dog breeder is maintaining his dogs well, and keeping them in good condition, then naturally he will charge more. 
* Purity of breed – Dogs of pure breed are often expensive than those of mixed breed.
* Champion Blood line – Just like horses, puppies of champion and trained dogs are often more expensive. 

There are many dog breeds that are easily available for free, or at a very cheap rate. Here’s a list of some of the dog breeds that are pretty much affordable:
* Pariah (Indian native dog or INDog) – No need to buy. You can easily adopt them from a dog NGO. 
* Kombai – Can adopt from an NGO for free.
* Pomeranian – They are so common in India, that you can easily adopt them from your friends or relative. But even if you want to buy, you can get them at around Rs. 5,000 to 10,000. 
* Indian Spitz – At around Rs. 4,000 to 6,000
* Pug – At around Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 12,000
* Dalmatian – At around Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 15,000
* Dachshund – At around Rs. 8,000 to 12,000
* Beagle – At around Rs. 8,000 to 16,000
* Labradors - At around Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 15,000
* English Cocker Spaniel - At around Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 15,000

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

It’s absolutely legal to adopt local street dogs in India. So, if you like them, go ahead and adopt a few. They are as good a breed, as any other breed out there. Some of them are of mixed breed though.

## Most Expensive Dog breeds in India

However, if you are into finer things in life, and want your dog to be a symbol of your social status, then there are some pretty expensive dog breeds too that you can explore. Some of us fall in love with a breed that costs a fortune to buy. Whatever be the reason, we are here to help you out. 

Though keep in mind, that dog prices may vary from one city to another, and even from one season to another. 

Here’s a list of some of the most expensive breeds in India.
* Golden Retriever – Rs. 15,000 to 20,000
* German Shepherd – At around Rs. 10,000 to 20,000.
* Doberman – At around Rs. 15,000 to 20,000
* Great Dane – Rs. 12,000 to 25,000
* Shih Tzu - Rs. 20,000 to 25,000
* Boxers – Rs. 20,000 to 22,000 
* Bull Mastiff – Rs. 35,000 to 40,000
* French Mastiff – Rs. 25,000 to 30,000
* Tibetan Mastiff – Rs. 25,000 to 30,000

Though, how much a dog costs doesn’t matter much if you are looking to get yourself a pal. A dog doesn’t know its cost, and surely won’t behave that way. 

Friendship of a dog and its trust are invaluable, intangible assets – no money in the world can buy that. It has to be earned. Your money or social status means nothing to a dog. All that he needs is your love, care and affection. 


## Dog breeds suitable for apartment living conditions

Majority of us have lived, or are living in flats and apartments. Here’s a list of dog breeds that are suitable for such living conditions. 

Most of them are small-sized and/or low energy dogs. Large dogs that are very active are not suitable for small houses or apartments, as they need a lot of space to play and fool around. 

However, the following dogs are perfect for flats, small houses and apartments: 
* Shih Tzu
* Pug
* Indian Spitz and Pomeranian – But they bark a lot. So, make sure your neighbours do not get easily irritated. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Unlike cats, rabbits, and fishes, dogs need a lot of space to run around and exercise. So, adopt or buy a dog only if you have a decent size house, preferably with some open space (e.g. porch, garden, etc.). I adopted my dogs only when I got a big house, and someone to live in that house 24/7. I never kept a dog pet while I was living in an apartment/flat, though I wanted too, as I knew my dog will not be very happy living in such a small space and there was no one to take care of it once I leave for job. 

Dogs hate living alone, and as they are like kids, they should always be monitored. Leaving them alone for long duration of time is not a good idea – Be prepared for a lot of howling, and barking if you do so. 
</div>

Though we can keep many small-size dog breeds in apartments (many people do), but make sure that you take them out on a daily basis – not only for nature’s call, but also to play around, and socialize with other dogs. Dogs just love going out and playing with their friends. Not allowing them this opportunity will rather be an act of cruelty. 


## Best Guard Dog breeds

If you are looking to get a dog for safety purpose, then you have the following options available in India:
* German Shepherd – Good guard dog, as well as a family dog as they are not very aggressive in general. 
* Doberman – Good guard dogs, and ok with family. 
* Pariah and Kombai (Indian street dog) – Decent guard dogs, but not that good with kids. 
* Bull Mastiff and French mastiff - Good guard dogs, and fine with family as they are not very aggressive in general. 
* Rottweiler and Pitbull – Good guard dogs, but not suitable to be kept with family as they can get real violent sometimes. 

However, you need to have a big house, with a lot of open space if you want to keep these dogs. They are not suitable for small houses or apartments. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Watch dogs</b><br>

If you want a watch dog then Pomeranians and Indian Spitz may be good options. Though they cannot fight, but they sure will bark a lot and scare away any intruder. 

When thieves do their research to identify the best houses to attack, presence or absence of dogs is always a factor they consider. Even small dogs who bark a lot, may remove your house from their hit list.
