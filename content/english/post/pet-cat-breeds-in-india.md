  <b>Warning</b><br>

In India, we cannot keep wild cats as pets. Most of the animals found in the wild are protected under Wildlife Conservation Act of India. 

But we can keep many other kinds of cats as pets, some exotic breeds, some imported – all of whom are typical pet cat breeds.

So, here we will just focus on the ***pet cat breeds*** available in India. 

## Common Cat breeds in India

### Persian Cat

These cats are of Iranian origin, and are also known by other names, such as Persian longhair, Shirazi, etc. These cats are one of the most famous pet cat breeds in India.

They are of medium-large size and can be found in white, black, red, chocolate, cream colours. Though you will most often come across the white coloured Persian cat. They have a healthy lifespan of 14-15 years. 

As these cats have a dense fur, a lot of effort and attention needs to be paid on their grooming. Also, they throw a lot of tantrums and are a little fussy.

  <b>Note</b><br>

There’s a toy version, i.e. very small version of Persian cats too. It’s a small-sized cat and naturally its fur are short too.

### Siamese Cat

It’s one of the most active and intelligent cat breeds out there. So, obviously they tend to be pretty naughty too. If you get easily irritated, then don’t get these cats. They will try to interact with you a lot.

It’s a medium size cat, with full-size tantrums. Ignore them at your own peril! 

They need attention, and will grab it anyhow. I have seen them pretend to cry, just to gain attention of their owners. Imagine that!

They have blue eyes, and in general you will find them in silver-grey fur colour. 

### Maine Coon 

They are large cats of US origin. They are also known by some other names, such as Molly, Susie, Gentle Giants.

They easily adjust to various climatic conditions, and thus are prevalent across the world. 

They are very gentle in nature (hence the name Gentle Giants). Consider them opposite to the Siamese Cat in nature. They are pretty laid-back and won’t bother you much now and then. 

So, if you have small kids at home, you may consider getting this cat breed. They will turn out to be your and your kids’ best friends. 

You can get them in various colours, such as black, white, blue, cream, etc. 

### Bombay Cat

Bombay cats are also gentle and calm in nature. They look like miniature version of black panther, with a black shiny fur, golden eyes, and a somewhat muscular build.

They are small-medium in size and can adapt to various environments and lifestyles easily. You may easily train them, and can even take them out for a walk with leash, just like a small dog. If there is a perfect combination of dog species and cat species anywhere in the world, this is it!

Though they are calm in nature, however they like playing around a lot. So, make sure they get enough toys and get to learn a lot of tricks. They will love it. 

In a way, you can say that they are a hybrid of Siamese Cat and Maine Coon, when it comes to nature – a perfect mixture of calmness and naughtiness. 

### Himalayan Cats 

Mostly found in white colour, they are very similar to Persian cats. That’s because they are a cross breed of Persian and Siamese cats. And this makes them a tit bit expensive. 
<img src="../../images/post/himalayan-cat.jpg" alt="cats" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

They are lap cats, as they just love the companionship of humans and enjoy being with us. They are pretty lazy in nature, and you won’t find them jumping around a lot. Lap is where they belong. 

It’s because of this laid-back nature of them, that they are pretty comfortable with other pets too. 
They are identified by colouration on their face, and their blue eyes. 

### Spotted Cat / Indian Cat

This is the cat that we Indians are most acquainted with. We often see them in our streets and rooftops. Obviously, it’s the most commonly found cat in India, and well adjusted to our climatic conditions. 
It has a short and spotted grey fur. But it has a comparatively long tail.

Though they are pretty shy and afraid of strangers, but once befriended they can be your most loyal friend. They can live as well indoors, as they live outdoors.

  <b>Note</b><br>

As far as possible, we should try to adopt a cat, rather than buy them. This is more so true in case of Indian Cat. As these cats are very commonly found in India, you should never buy them. Just befriend a cat nearby your residence, or adopt them from an animal NGO.

### Ragdoll

These are large looking cats of American origin. They have very fascinating blue eyes. 
They are found in various colours, such as cream, chocolate, red, etc., and have a life-span of 13-16 years. 

### Abyssinian 

These are short looking cats of Egyptian origin. They are found in various colours, such as cinnamon, chocolate, black, etc. They have a life-span of 14-15 years. 

### Scottish Fold

As the name suggests, they have Scottish origin (i.e. in United Kingdom). They are of medium height and can be found in various colours – white, black, cream, silver, etc. They have a life-span of 11-13 years.

### Devon Rex

They are small-sized cats with very silky and short fur. They originate from United Kingdom (UK), and are also known by many other names, such as Alien cat, and Pixie cat. 
They are one of the cutest breeds of cats and have a lifespan of 12-15 years. 

### American Shorthair

American Shorthair or Domestic Shorthair cats are American in origin (USA to be precise). They are very cute medium-large size cats, with a lifespan of 12-15 years. You can get them in tabby, black, brown, and silver colours. 

### Sphynx  

They are a bit odd (and maybe scary) looking cats of Canadian origin. That’s because they are furless. 
Do you remember the cat Rachel got in one of the episodes of the famous sitcom ***Friends***? – Well, that was a Sphynx. They can be found in white, cream, black, chocolate colours, and have a lifespan of 12-14 years.

Apart from these cat breeds, here’s a list of some more that you may consider:
* Exotic Shorthair – Medium size cats of US origin. These are pretty peaceful and cute cats. 
* British Shorthair (Britannica) – Large size cats of UK origin. 
* American Bobtail – They have a shiny coat and are muscular in built (just like Bombay cat). Their unique tail is their most outstanding feature. 

We hope this article would have served its purpose of introducing you to the fascinating world of cats. Now, just listen to your heart and get the breed that you think complements your personality the best. 

Though whatever you choose, you will never get it wrong. Every cat is a bundle of joy and affection. Just a friend in waiting. Best of luck!
