How long do parrots live? Hmm. The answer to this question is not so simple, because there are more than 250 species of parrots. The diversity is huge. You will find parrots of different colours, sizes, shapes, and the average lifespan of different parrot species varies a lot too. 

Some parrots live only for 20-30 years, while some species are known to live for over a hundred years.

## Why should I know about the lifespan of my parrot? 

If you are planning to get a pet parrot, do enquire about the lifespan of that species. It's really important due to three reasons:

* A pet who lives for many years is a big responsibility. It's like getting a toddler for life. You must be aware of what you are getting into and be mentally prepared. 

* Some parrot species may easily outlive you. So, you will have to decide who will take care of them, once you are gone. Ideally, a pet parrot should not outlive you, because these birds make very strong bonds with their owners. We have seen parrots getting psychologically unstable after the death of their owners. After living with someone for all their life, they cannot easily adapt to the wild or with some new owner. 

* It's essential to know when your parrot will start growing old, as they will need extra medical attention in old age. 


## How long do parrots live in captivity?

Parrots generally live longer in captivity if they are treated well, i.e. they are given ample space to play, given nutritious food, fellow parrots to socialize with etc. 

Lifespan of parrots is lower in the wild due to various predators, diseases etc.

Generally, the bigger a bird is, the longer it will live and vice-versa. Same is true for parrots too. Larger parrots live longer.

Well, let's cut to the chase. Let's see how long different parrots actually live. 

### Lifespan of African grey parrots 

In captivity their lifespan maybe 40-60 years or more. But in wild they live for 20 to 25 years only. 

### Lifespan of Amazon parrots 

Their lifespan varies a lot, from 25 to 75 years. In general, they can live for more than 50 years in captivity. 

### Parakeets 

There are various sub-species within Parakeets. Let's see the lifespan of some of them.

* Indian rose-ringed parakeet - 20 to 30 years 
* Plain Parakeet - Around 15 years 
* Budgerigar - 5 to 10 years

### Lifespan of some other parrots

* Cockatiels - 10 to 15 years in the wild and 15-25 years in captivity. 

* Cockatoos - minimum 20 years, maximum 70 years. 

* Eclectus parrots - minimum 30 and maximum 50 years.  


## How to tell the age of your parrot?

When you buy a new parrot, you should try to know the age of that parrot. You should ask the previous owner about its age. 

Check the band on the feet of the parrot. The letters and numbers on the band may contain the information put-in by the breeder of that parrot, regarding the identification of that parrot and its age. 

To be doubly sure, you can have a look at the parrot and try to guess its age. Even if you are not an expert, there are some signs that can help you gauge the age of a parrot. Let's see some of these signs. 

* Younger parrots will seem more active than older ones. They will be more aggressive too. 

* Feathers of younger parrots are brighter, more colourful and vibrant. 

* Younger parrots generally have a shorter tail. 

* Look into its eyes. Generally, young parrots have completely black eyes. While, adult parrots usually have a yellow line surrounding the eye pupils. But it's not true for all parrots. Some parrots (e.g. Albino parrots) never change their eye colour ever.  


## What issues are generally seen in ageing parrots?

Ageing parrots can suffer from various ailments. Some of them have been listed below:

* Tumours - They have generally been observed in aging parrots.

* Eye conditions - Cataracts, issues in retina are common.

* Osteoarthritis - It is the most common form of arthritis in pet birds. 

* Diseases of the liver and kidneys 

* Gout - Uric acid deposits on joints or tissue surface in birds. Uric acid stones can swell the areas where they accumulate (generally in the feet), resulting in pain and mobility issues.


## Winding Up

Parrots are among the longest living bird pets out there. Larger the parrot, the longer it will live. 

Before purchasing a parrot, you should try to know both:
* the average age of that parrot breed in captivity.
* the probable age of that particular parrot that you are buying. 

Keeping the above points in mind will help you make better choices while buying a parrot, and will also allow you to treat your parrot better in its old age.
