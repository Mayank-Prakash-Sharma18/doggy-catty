One of the most attractive and most entertaining quality of a parrot is that it can speak. Well, not all the parrots, but some sure can. This is what separates them from all other pets out there. 

So, if you are planning to get a parrot for this purpose, or if you are finding it hard to get your parrot to talk, then please do read on.

## Steps to teach your Parrot to talk

Let's have a look at the steps that you need to follow to train your parrot to speak. You may skip or shift some of these steps up and down, depending on your convenience and that of your parrot. Remember, every parrot is unique. So, you may have to be creative and improvise some of these training techniques. 

### Step 1: Trust building 

This is the first step, whether you want to train your parrot for talking, or stop biting, or anything else. A pet will not listen to you, if it doesn't trust you. 

So, once you get a parrot, don't rush things. For a month or two just focus on taking care of your parrot. Spend some time with him. Let him acclimatize with the new conditions and new people. Let him emotionally bond with you. Training can wait.

  <b>When should we start training a parrot to talk?</b><br>

A parrot may start speaking when it is just 6 months old. By the time it gets 8 months or a year old, he can speak really well. 

In fact, just like human kids, it's easier for a parrot to learn when they are young. So, you may start training your parrot to speak when it gets around 4-5 months old, and has made a good bond with you. 

However, I have seen much older parrots learn speaking too, even 5-6 year olds. So, there is no age-limit as such, but it becomes a bit harder for a parrot to learn new things with age.

### Step 2: Teach them their name

The second step is to let it know its name, whatever you have chosen for it. This is something we do with any of our pets anyways. We want our pet to respond when we take its name, be it your dog, cat or a parrot. 

And how do we do that?

Repeat, Repeat and Repeat again! 

Sit near your parrot's cage and take its name, say "mitthu". Take its name when you are feeding it, interacting with it etc. This is the rote memorization technique, wherein someone learns something just by the sound of it, without learning its meaning. 

Your parrot will try to repeat that word soon. In due course of time, it will also get to know that it's his name. So, chances are that it will be the first word that your parrot will speak. 

This process may take a month or two. So, make sure you are talking to your parrot on a regular basis (without irritating it!). The start is always slow, so you will have to be patient.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Some parrots may learn making some sounds, much before they speak clear words. For example, I have seen many parrots who first started whistling, and making laughing sounds, before they uttered even a single word.

### Step 3: Positive reinforcements

If you have read psychology, then you are probably familiar with the concept of positive reinforcements. This is a technique wherein we reward good behaviour of an animal or human. 

So, whenever your parrot tries to speak, reward him. Reward may be emotional, e.g. petting him, loving him etc. You may also give him treats, something he really likes to eat.

  <b>Note</b><br>

You may get a clicker from the market. Instead of directly giving them treats, you may click the clicker whenever your parrot tries to speak and then give him some treat. Soon your parrot will make an association with the clicker - "Clicking sound means I have done something right, and soon I will get a reward."

### Step 4: Teach other words, sentences, songs

Once your parrot has learnt its name and maybe started making some sounds like whistling, you can now teach him other words. The techniques to do so are the same as we used to teach them their name. 

You may make them listen to some songs, repeat some sentences etc. If they are responding to you, or any other sound clues, they will soon start speaking longer sentences. Maybe, they will dance on tunes a bit too!
