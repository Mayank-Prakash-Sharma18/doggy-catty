Are you sure you really have a Pomeranian?

Many people often get confused between Pomeranians and Indian Spitzs. Often pet shops sale us Indian Spitz puppies in the name of Pomeranians, as Pomeranians are a little more expansive than Indian Spitz. 

In fact, when I was a kid, I had an Indian Spitz for many years and we used to think that it’s a Pomeranian. Not that I am complaining. Personally, I like Indian Spitz more than Pomeranians. But still, it’s hilarious to have a dog for over a decade and not know what breed that is!

Anyways, let’s shed some light on these two very famous and cute small dog breeds. Frankly, it doesn’t matter which dog you get, but you have the right to know what it actually is.

## List of differences between Pomeranians and Indian Spitzs

### Looks

Pomeranians and Indian Spitzs do look a lot similar. However, they can easily be identified. Let’s have a look at these differences:

* Pomeranians are small-size dogs. In comparison, Indian Spitzs are a bit larger in size. They can be called small- to medium-size dogs.

  <b>Types of Indian Spitz</b><br>

There are majorly two types of Indian Spitz:
* Smaller Indian Spitz: They are 8 to 10 inches in height. So, they are almost the same size as that of Pomeranians. 
* Greater Indian Spitz: They are 15 to 18 inches in height.

  <b>Types of Pomeranians</b><br>

There are majorly two types of Pomeranians:
* Culture pom – They are 7 to 10 inches in height. 
* Toy pom – They are even smaller in size.

* Their faces differ a bit too. Pomeranians have a smaller-size face. That is, Pomeranians have a smaller muzzle (nose and mouth), as compared to Indian Spitz.

  <b>Origins of Pomeranians and Indian Spitzs</b><br>

Pomeranians are from an area near Germany and Poland. They used to be medium size dogs, but Queen Victoria of England made them breed with small dogs, and that produced the small-size Pomeranians that we see now. In fact, Pomeranians are said to be related to German Spitzs. 

Indian Spitzs are not of Indian origin either. They are also related to German Spitz. When Britishers came to India, they brought some German Spitzs with them. Slowly these dogs adapted to the local climate of India and became Indian Spitz. 

Popularity of Indian Spitzs grew a lot during 1990s when import of dogs was banned in India. They even featured in many Bollywood movies, such as 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' (1994).

### Price

Pomeranians are a little more expansive than Indian Spitzs. Though the difference is not very high. Both of them are in low price range of dogs. 

While you can get a good quality Indian Spitz for just around 4-6 thousand rupees (inferior quality for even less), you may have to spend 6-10 thousand for a Culture Pomeranian. Some Pomeranian breeds (such as Toy Pom) are even more expansive. Price of Toy Pom is around 18 to 22 thousand rupees. 

However, as both of these dog breeds are very common in India, you may easily get them from a friend or relative. So, no need to buy. We should always prefer to adopt a dog, rather than buy them, as far as possible. 

### Athletic Ability

As Indian Spitzs are bigger in size, with longer legs, they run faster too. So, if you like a dog that can run around a lot in open spaces and play with you, you should prefer Indian Spitz. 

My Indian Spitz used to play ball-fetch with me in big playgrounds and parks. I used to throw ball to the other end of a large ground and he used to fetch it without any problem. He just enjoyed playing outside. 

Pomeranians are more of a lap dog and so are not very good when it comes to running. 

### Bark

Though both of these dog-types bark a lot, their bark varies a bit. Bark of Indian Spitz is louder and more intimidating as compared to Pomeranians. So, they are more useful in scaring away people and animals. 

However, if you are living in an apartment where neighbours are close by, you should prefer a Pomeranian. Indian Spitz bark a lot and very loudly. Almost as loud as any Indian street dog. 


## Similarities between Pomeranians and Indian Spitzs

Now, you must have developed an eye to differentiate between these two breeds. However, these dog breeds are more similar than different. Let’s list down some of their similarities too.

### Looks and Nature

They look a lot similar to each other. Both are very active and agile dogs. They have a playful nature and will do a lot of naughty activities all day long. 

These dogs are pretty intelligent. They can easily be trained, and can do various tricks. Though I never excessively trained my Indian Spitz, I did teach him the basic things – such as Sit, Come, Go, Hand shake, etc. 

These dogs like to stay in groups and make friends. So, make sure that they socialize with other dogs and humans. My dog even made friends with many stray dogs. They even used to protect him from attacks. 

In my experience, if you will keep them alone and tied up, then they will become sad, easily get irritated, and will bite people. I rarely tied my dog. He liked his freedom and I respected it. He probably was the happiest dog in the locality. 

### Watch Dogs

Though they cannot do much to safeguard your home, like many Guard dogs can (e.g. German Shephard, Labrador, etc.). But they can work pretty well as Watch dogs, or Alarm dogs. 

These are very vigilant dogs and can hear the faintest of the noise. Once they hear any noise at the main gate, or see any stranger they will bark a lot. Their bark is pretty loud too. It can easily scare away thieves. 

Moreover, they will not hesitate to attack any person who tries to intrude your home, or attack you. They are very attached to their owners. But as they are so small, there’s not much impact that they can have. 

### Life Span

These dogs have a similar life span. Both can live from 12 to 14 years if properly taken care of. 


## Winding Up

If I were you, I will not pull my hairs much when it comes to making a choice between these two dog breeds. They are more similar than different. Both are cute, little, white clouds of happiness. 

Moreover, many breeders nowadays breed them together. So, there’s a good chance that the puppy you are getting is part Pomeranian and part Indian Spitz. It becomes very hard to categorize such puppies. 

Just get a healthy puppy – either Pomeranian or Indian Spitz. You will never regret your decision. They will become your best friend in no time – will follow you everywhere, throw tantrums, get crazy when you get back home (even if you were out for only a few minutes!) 

And yes, both of them are very goofy, if that’s your thing. They do a lot of stupid things. They think that they are a big-size dog. My Indian Spitz used to attack dogs three times its size. Though he always used to get beaten up by other dogs in any battle, and we had to intervene to save him. But he used to forget the lesson learnt pretty soon. I tried to show him the mirror, so as to give him some perspective of his size – how small he is, but it didn’t work!  

Believe me. Everything they do is funny!
