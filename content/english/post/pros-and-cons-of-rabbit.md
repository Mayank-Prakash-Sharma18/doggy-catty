## Benefits of having Rabbits as pets

### Bundles of Joy

Rabbits are pretty cute. Though we can also say the same for puppies and kittens, but it’s all the more true for rabbits. Dogs and cats may lose some of their cuteness once they grow, but rabbits won’t. In fact, they become cuter as they grow.

You can’t be depressed in their company. Though they are not as interactive as dogs and cats are, they do make emotional bonds with their owners. They like cuddling too and you will often find them licking you. 

They are pretty loyal. You will often find them searching for you in the house. 
Happiness is an intangible asset that will always grow in a household having rabbits. This alone is reason enough to get them as your pets. 

### Cleanliness

Rabbits are pretty clean animals. Just like cats, they like to keep themselves clean and groomed. You will often find them licking and cleaning themselves. They even like arranging their stuff in order. Fancy that!

Moreover, just like cats, they do not emit bad odour from their body or their mouth. In contrast dogs do smell a lot, especially in wet, humid days. 

Though rabbit droppings may be an issue, but they may be potty trained. So, this issue can be easily resolved. Once they learn to use the litter box, you won’t be required to stress about their droppings. Just like cats, you need not take them out for this purpose – a headache that dog owners have to deal with on a daily basis. 

However, some people find their habit of eating their own poop appalling. Well, perhaps there are two sides to every coin. You have to decide whether this disgusting habit is a deal-breaker for you. 

### Smart pets

Rabbits are pretty intelligent and smart animals. They can sense danger, your mood etc. pretty well. They will come to you when they need something, and may ignore you completely if they find you useless. 

You may even teach them some tricks, and some essential habits like using the litter box. 

### Quiet pets

Rabbits and cats are considered quiet pets. Rabbits are even quieter than cats. So, if you are living in an apartment with numerous houses nearby, then rabbits will cause no issues with your neighbours. 
In comparison, pets like dogs and parrots make a lot of noise and may prove to be a headache, not only to you but also to the people that live nearby. 

Rabbits generally mind their own business and do not disturb people that much. So, you can sleep well even if you have a lot of rabbits in your house. Other pets will often disturb you while you are sleeping, working etc. 

However, rabbits do wake up early and are very active in the morning and at the night. You will often find them sleeping during afternoon. So, they might disturb you sometimes in the morning or night. Though not as much as a dog or a cat would. And you might find yourself getting bored during the day, if you stay with them during the day. 

### Herbivore pets

Rabbits are herbivores, i.e. they only eat plant-based diet. Arranging meat, eggs etc. for your pets may be a huge task if you live in a vegetarian household. You won’t have to worry about this with rabbits. 

Believe me, there are very few herbivore pets. So, rabbits are pretty good option for vegan people. 

### Long life

Pet rabbits live a considerable long life – 10 to 14 years. So, getting a pet rabbit is a long-time commitment. However, it also means that you will get to be with them for long. 


## Disadvantages of raising Rabbits

### High Maintenance

Having rabbits as pets may be a lot of work. You will have to clean the hair that they have shed, clean their litter box on a regular basis etc. They shed a lot, and they litter a lot too. Moreover, as you need to keep grass and hay for them 24/7, and rabbits chew on it a lot, it will also get spread all over your house. That means a lot of house cleaning and cloth washing. 

You also need to interact with them on a regular basis, give them toys etc. But probably you won’t mind that much, as they are so cute and adorable. 

Moreover, you need to be very careful while handling them. So, children may not play with them much – any rough handling on their part may hurt rabbits. Also, as they are easily scared, if you hurt them even unintentionally, they may get scared of you and stop trusting you. 

### Constant chewing

Rabbits chew a lot. Almost like rats. So, you need to keep grass and hay with them all the time. 
It’s important not just because your rabbit needs to eat, but also because if you won’t, then they may start chewing anything else they can – cords, shoes, ribbons anything. 

Though, there’s no guarantee that they won’t chew stuff in your house even if you give them all the hay and grass in the world. So, they can cause some destruction. 

It’s true for puppies too, but puppies do not have this constant urge to chew something all the time. So, this problem is more acute in case of rabbits. 

Make sure they have a separate room or place to live in. Also, keep any sensitive material out of their reach, especially if you are leaving them alone for some time. 

### Security Issue

Pet rabbits are constantly under threat. While dogs and cats are predators, rabbits are almost at the bottom of the food chain. They are often preyed upon by wild animals in the wild and hence you will often find them getting scared pretty easily. 

Wild hares have developed some self-preserving tactics and are very vigilant. However, unlike wild hares, white pet rabbits cannot survive in the wild or even outside your house for long. They need constant care and protection. 

You cannot take them out for a walk, as they may be attacked by dogs and other wild animals. Even if you do, you will have to be very vigilant. If they sense any danger, they may even run away, putting themselves in even more precarious situations. 

So, forget about playing with this pet outdoors. They are predominantly indoor pets, just like cats and parrots. 

Some people may find this extra-sensitive and scared nature of a pet very irritating and non-fun. If you are one of those guys, do not get a rabbit as your pet. You may get bored of them pretty soon. 

### Fragile Health 

Rabbits’ health is pretty fragile. They might get sick pretty easily and even lose their lives. Just having loose motions may be life-threatening for them.

So, having a rabbit means doing a lot of research on their diet, constantly monitor what they are eating, checking their poop on a regular basis to see if its showing some sign of abnormality etc. 

You cannot give them anything to eat, without proper research. Whenever you give them something new, even if it’s considered safe for rabbits, you must monitor them for any signs of discomfort, indigestion, gas or loose motions etc. 

### No Contact Comfort

Many of us get pets because we like touching and petting our pets, taking them in our arms, kissing them, cuddling with them. That is, contact comfort that our pets give us. 

Even most pets like dogs, cats and even parrots enjoy this contact comfort they get from their owners. It’s a part of the bonding process. 

Sadly, this is not true in case of rabbits. As rabbits are prey animals, if you will hold them or pick them up from the ground, then their survival instincts will get activated. They will start feeling insecure, as if they have been captured by a predator. 

So, rabbits are more like fishes – pet animals to be watched and admired. Though you may touch and pet your rabbit to some extent, but they prefer it when their feet are on the ground. This way they feel safer. 

So, these were some of the advantages and disadvantages of having pet rabbits. Consider them, discuss with your family members and then take an informed decision. See if anyone of these is something that you cannot compromise with. 

But if you really like rabbits, go ahead. In these matters, you should listen more to your heart, than your brain. You won’t make a wrong decision.
