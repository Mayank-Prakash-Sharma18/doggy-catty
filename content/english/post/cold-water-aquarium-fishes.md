Unlike other pets, keeping fishes in our house requires us to do a lot of maintenance work – frequent change of aquarium water, checking water pH and temperature, maintaining the heater, etc. For some of us lazy souls all this may become pretty overwhelming pretty soon. 

So, if you still want to have fishes at your home or office, but do not want to constantly worry about a plethora of aquarium maintenance issues, you should opt for cold water fishes. Unlike warm water fishes, you need not install a heater for these fishes. This rules out at least one thing off the regular maintenance list.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Aquarium heater is needed in cold countries. In warm countries, you probably won’t even need one. Well, maybe in winter season. 

So, do some research on the annual and diurnal temperature variation in the place you are staying, and the temperature variation that your fish may comfortably be exposed to.

## What are cold water fishes?

Cold water fishes are those fishes that can live in relatively cold or non-warm water or fresh water. So, they do not need us to artificially warm the water for them using a heater. 

Though the ideal temperature for them may vary a lot. Some of them will be more comfortable at room temperature (say around 65°F or 18°C), while others may even survive in icy ponds. So, do a little bit of research on the species you want to buy. 

And kindly do not start pouring ice cubes in your fish tank just because you think that a cold-water-fish needs freezing cold water! 

As you may have guessed, things are not as simple even with cold water fishes. There are still some minute points that you will need to keep in mind. Let’s have a look at some of these cold-water fishes and dive a bit deeper.

Some other cold water fishes are:
* Sunset Variatus – About 2-3 inches; prefer water just above pH 7; can be placed in heated aquariums too. 
* Celestial Pearl Danio – These are nano fishes and so can be kept even in small fish tanks; pH between 7 and 7.5.
* Endlers Livebearers – Standard Endlers livebearers are pretty hardy, but the new breed varieties need warm water; pH 6.6 to 8.4. 
* Clown Killifish – Need to be kept in a closed aquarium (i.e. with a lid) as they can hop out of the aquarium; pH 6.6 to 7.6; Name is kind of a misnomer as they are pretty docile, not aggressive.

  <b>Warning</b><br>

For most of these cold-water fishes, or fishes in general, keeping them in the higher temperature ranges boosts their metabolism. This reduces their lifespan.
