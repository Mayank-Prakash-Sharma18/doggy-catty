  <b>Warning</b><br>

Though we can keep foreign, imported and some exotic pet parrot breeds as pets in our homes. However, it’s illegal to keep wild parrots as pets in India. It’s a punishable crime under India’s Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

So, though people buy and adopt many Indian wild parrots, it’s illegal. You cannot keep these parrots as pets in India - Indian ringneck parakeets, Alexandrine parakeets, Plum headed parakeets, etc. 

Moreover, it’s not a good idea to keep a wild parrot as pet anywhere in the world. Wild parrots are not finetuned to indoor lifestyle and may even hurt you or your kids.

## Pet Parrot breeds in India

Here we will list down some of the popular pet parrot breeds that are often kept as pets in India.

### Budgies

They are one of the cutest and hence one of the most popular pet parrots. These Australian origin parrots are very friendly in nature, and due to their small size, they are easy to maintain.

There are two types of Budgies – Show Budgies and Normal Budgies. Show Budgies are a bit bigger in size. 
There are various mutations of them available in the market, and hence you can get them in various colours. There’s a lot of colour variety available in case of these parrots. 

They can be kept in small spaces too. But it’s always a good idea to give them enough space, even though they are tiny. 

They can speak and mimic many common household sounds. However, they are not as loud as many large parrots are. So, you can keep them even if you live in an apartment, where your neighbours live nearby.

They can be bought at Rs. 300-500. So, they are pretty cheap too. Show budgies are a little expensive than normal budgies though. They have a lifespan of 5-10 years.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Though many people buy small parrots like Budgies as decorative birds. However, we should treat every animal with respect, and love. They are not objects to be used as decorative items. If you are buying/adopting a parrot, kindly treat them as your own kids, as people.

### Cockatiel 

This breed looks like a cock, especially the comb type hair on its head. Hence the name Cockatiel. 
This breed is very friendly in nature. They are less aggressive and do not bite that often.

Though they cannot speak, but they can whistle pretty well, especially the male Cockatiels. They often whistle on seeing their owner, the things they like, or on seeing their reflection in the mirror.

However, just like Budgies, they are not as loud as many large parrots are. So, you can keep them even if you live in an apartment, where your neighbours live nearby. As they are small in size, they are ideal for small apartments. 

You will often get them tamed in India. Even if they are not, you can easily tame them. 

They can be bought at Rs. 800-1500. So, they are pretty cheap too. Though some of their mutations may be a bit expensive. They have a lifespan of 10-14 years. 

### Pacific Parrotlets

These small parrots of American origin are very active in nature. They need a lot of attention, and so they do not like to live with other pets. They just hate to share the love and attention of their owners. 
<img src="../../images/post/pacific-parrotlets-parrot.jpg" alt="parrots" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

They can easily be trained, and can speak too. 

They can be bought at Rs. 4000-5000. So, they are comparatively cheap. They have a lifespan of 14-18 years. 

### Sun Conure

These South American parrots have the same colour as a sunrise, or a sunset. Very awesome to look at. 
<img src="../../images/post/sun-conure-parrot.jpg" alt="parrots" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

These are pretty active birds too, and like to spend most of their time outside of the cage. When they are in playful and adventurous mood, they make a lot of sounds. 

They can be bought at Rs. 15k-25k. So, they are in the moderate price range. They have a lifespan of 15-20 years. 

### Macaw

These South American parrots are very social in nature. They like to be with people and other pets. They can talk too. 
<img src="../../images/post/macaw-parrot.jpg" alt="parrots" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

Most of the Macaws are big-size parrots, and so they need some extra maintenance. They have a long lifespan of 35-45 years. 

There are various kinds of Macaw and all are legal to be kept as pets in India. Hahns macaw can be bought at Rs. 40k-50k. But Blue and Gold Macaw are more popular in India. They can be bought at Rs. 1-2 lakhs. So, they are pretty expensive, but they look pretty awesome too.

  <b>Note</b><br>

If you are buying a parrot, then either take young parrots that can easily be tamed, or those that have already been tamed. 
</div>

Some other parrots that you can keep as pets in India are:
* African Grey Parrots – May cost you Rs. 40k to 50k. 
* Orange Winged Amazon, Blue Fronted Amazon, Yellow Crowned Amazon
* Cockatoo
* Monk Parakeets
* Eclectus Parrot

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Note</b><br>

If you have no experience of taking care of a parrot, and are an absolute beginner in this respect, then you may avoid buying parrots such as African Grey Parrots, Macaw, etc. Bigger parrots need more maintenance, and are costly. You will need a big cage for them, and will need to take them to a vet on a regular basis. If you travel a lot, then keeping a big bird would probably not be a good idea. And taking them along with you may cost you a lot. 

Big parrots are also comparatively more social, and you need to spend 3-4 hours daily with them, till they get attached with you. They absolutely need to socialize. Otherwise, they may develop very bad attitude and showcase aggressive behaviour like biting, destroying stuff to get your attention, etc. They have been seen to show signs of anxiety and depression. 

Rather start with small-size parrots that are:

* easier to train and tame
* easier to take care of

So, go for breeds like Budgies, Cockatiel, etc. Though they are easily maintainable, however it does not mean that you ignore the bare minimum. Do get a large cage for small parrots too, so that they get enough space to exercise and move around. You should also spend some time with them, but it’s not that essential. Some people keep these birds just as decorative birds too. 

One other point to consider is kids. Big parrots can hurt your kids. On the other hand, small parrots are very delicate and your kids can hurt them. You will not only have to train your parrots, but also your kids on how to handle these birds, and how to interact with them. Moreover, in the initial few months, some adult must be there to supervise.

## What are the pet parrots in India that can speak?

Many people get motivated to get a pet parrot, just because they can speak. This is a unique feature of parrots, that no other pet can provide. 

Here’s a list of some of the most common pet breeds in India, that are known to speak, or mimic the sounds around them.
* Budgies
* Pacific Parrotlets
* Macaw
* African Grey – When it comes to speaking, they are probably one of the best. 


## What are the cheapest pet parrots in India?

Though there are many breeds that may cost you thousands and even lakhs of rupees. However, not all parrot breeds are that expensive. You can get many awesome parrot breeds at very reasonable price. 

If you are going to get a pet parrot for the first time, then it’s a good idea to go for an inexpensive parrot. 

Let’s list down some of such parrot breeds.
* Budgies - Rs. 300-500. You will find them in almost all bird shops. They are very common. They are probably the easiest parrots to maintain. So, they are ideal for beginners. 
* Cockatiel - Rs. 800-1500. They are probably the second most popular pet parrot breeds in India. Some of their mutated versions are expensive though, e.g. Albino Cockatiel parakeet (they are white in colour) may cost you Rs. 6000-8000. 
* Peach Faced Lovebirds – They are easily available in India. However, generally you will not get them tamed. So, get them at a young age. Though they are pretty cheap, however some of their mutated versions can be expensive. (All types of Lovebirds are allowed as pets in India)
* Green Cheeked Conure – They are pretty common in India, and you will easily get them tamed. They are pretty cheap, though some of their mutations may be a bit expensive (e.g. Cinnamon, Pineapple, etc.). They are easy to care too. 
* Monk Parakeets – They are also pretty common in India. 
* Zebra Finches – Though they are not expensive, and are easy to take care of. However, you will hardly get them tamed from the pet shop, and taming them is pretty hard. (All types of Finches are allowed as pets in India)

However, do not drag your feet too much in research. Just choose a breed that calls to you, and read a bit about their feeding habits, care tips, etc. 

Any parrot you get, will become your best friend in time, if you bestow it with enough love, affection, and care. Just treat them as a friend, rather than a pet. That’s the most important tip there is when it comes to pet care. 

Now, don’t procrastinate anymore. Just go ahead, and get a treat for your heart and soul!
