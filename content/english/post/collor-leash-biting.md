Let's talk about why they bite.


## Why do dogs bite their collar and leash?

They bite because they want to be the leader and free. Currently as a human, you are walking and leading them the way you want. But sometimes they want to go somewhere else. They want to follow their free spirit. This is why they bite showing their aggression. This is their way of telling that I don't want to go there and instead want to go somewhere else.


## Why we need to use collar and leash?

Leash and collar are needed if you want to take your dog for a walk. But they serve many other purposes apart from helping you control your dog. 

* You should write your address in the dog's collar. Just in case you lose him, someone may return him to you by seeing that address. 
* A collar lets people know that the given dog is a pet and not a stray, wild dog. 
* Also, a collar protects your dog from getting seriously injured if some other wild dog attacks him. Dogs generally attack on the neck of rival dogs, and that neck injury is often critical. 

So, it's always a good idea to train your dog to get used to his collar and leash. But it won't be an easy task initially. You dog will definitely resist it. He will bite it, cry and growl. 

My dog, Tigger, also used to bite his collar and leash initially when he started going on walks. The solution to fix it is very simple. 


## How to stop your dog from biting his collar?

Whenever your puppy or dog bites the leash during walking, say 'No' right there in a hard voice, so that he/she understands that it is not allowed to do. Say 'No' every time whenever he/she bites. If he/she bites 100 times then you have to say 'No' 100 times. Then only he/she will learn. 

Also stop walking right then. Whenever he bit, I said 'No' and stopped walking. Since puppies/dogs like to walk they learn quickly that they did something wrong and that's why we stopped walking.

Whenever Tigger started biting, I used to stop right there on the street. If tigger kept doing it, I would not move. I will say 'No' each time he bites and will stop walking. You need to convey clearly that until you stop biting, I won't move forward. 


## Winding Up

Keep in mind that you should remove the leash when it's not required. Let them be the way they are. They won't be able to tell you if they are feeling uncomfortable, say because of an itch in the neck. 

Believe me, if you are using the leash and collar only when you are taking him for a walk, they will look forward to be leashed. Tigger even used to bring his collar and leash to me when he wanted to go out!
